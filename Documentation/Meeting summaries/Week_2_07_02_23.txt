Questions going in:
Do you think using GA is a good idea for the project?
Rename to Evolutionary algorithms rather than genetic algorithms, what makes it unique compared to others work?

For the project outline I do not really have a great justification for the problem and it makes for a weak project description, how can I improve on this?
General outline to use:
The puzzle exists and want to solve it
It has already been solved well with constraint programming
Want to use a heuristic approach, 2500 publications on google scholar
Follow Russel/Norvig principled approach
building up from simple start to more complex heuristics
First go to Local search
How is the puzzle encoded
How do you enforce rules
What makes one neighbour better than another
Step 2 Simulated annealing
Does it do any better?
Step 3
Evolutionary algorithms
Uses the local search but adds in crossover
Does it do any better

Do I need to add anything in the description of final report and demonstration, it seems self explanitory to me?
Add dates for them, not much else needed

Other topics discussed:
Harmony search is not a good search method
Do further reading on Evolutionary algorithms

Goals for next week:
Literature search for sudoku in EA:
- encoding/representation, look at what others have done, make an informed decision for the project. 
- operators/neighbourhoods, looks at the methods others have used, see how to apply.
- constraint handling for EA, look at methods other have used, see how it can be applied.
