\section{Evaluation}
\subsection{Reflecting on process}
made decisions late on in the process
could have done more relevant research into certain areas
questions for the hypothesis were formed late on into the process
use of agile style development worked against the research project style
\subsection{Reflecting on design, implementation and testing}
Algorithms, had some naive designs, which later affected implementation
stuff like the greedy approach
Some of these mistakes were corrected partway through development but some were integrated/kept which had a lasting affect on the outcome of the project
Documentation of design was poor, so many design ideas and decisions made early on, had nowhere to be solidly
due to the design and implemenation issues the experiment also suffered, leaving the second hypothesis unanswered, needs a better, more efficient design for both algorithms


\subsection{Reflection on tool usage}
Github was use incosistantly at best
the kanban board was not updated every week to deal with tasks brought up in the weekly meetings
use of other tools generally good
good use of 3rd party library
\subsection{Research and report}
