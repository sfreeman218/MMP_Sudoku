\section{Results and Conclusions}
\subsection{Results from test program}
Talk about general results from the test, further 
Struggles/ issues caused by the experiment i.e large amount of failure and long run times for medium and up difficulties

\subsection{Comparing methods}
Evaluate the results showing data and statistical tests for both the 4x4 and 9x9 easy
Look at each sub question
\subsection{Conclusion for experiment 1}
Get an overall summary for the main question of experiment
\subsection{Comparing difficulty}
Reasons for experiment 2 overall failure
likely to do with algorithms greedy approaches, meaning that they get stuck in inescapable incorrect solutions

what we could find out if anything for each question
also add speculation about the difficulty and the increased number of empty spaces causing the issue

\subsection{Conclusion for hypothesis 2}
